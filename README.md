DO THIS IF YOU HAVE TRUBBLE PUSHING:

edit .git/config file under your repo directory

find url=entry under section [remote "origin"]

change it from url=https://github.com/derekerdmann/lunch_call.git to url=ssh://git@github.com/derekerdmann/lunch_call.git. 

that is, change all the texts before @ symbol to ssh://git@

Save config file and quit. now you could use git push origin master to sync your repo on GitHub
